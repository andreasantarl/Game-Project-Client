Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project!

You can view the project here: http://andreasantarl.github.io/Game-Project-Client/

The technologies/languages used in this program are:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- AJAX
- JSON

To plan this game out, I tried to think about all of the tasks a user would expect
and want to accomplish when playing a tic-tac-toe game.

First, someone would want to be able to create a username, sign in, sign out, and
change their password.  This would be integral for storing client data.

Next, the game would alternate between seeing one player move and then having
the other player be able to move and not overwrite the opponent's move.  I set
out to create that logic, and then I moved on to the game winning conditions.

The conditions were set by comparing values that were stored based upon where
each player moved.  I checked to see if X or O had any of the winning conditions
and then printed the results to the screen.  Otherwise, if all the game tiles
were filled, the game would be considered a draw.

After that was completed, I moved on to setting up the AJAX requests so the game
results would be updated regularly and so user X could see how many games had been played.

Finally, I styled the program to make it user-friendly and only show necessary
clickable elements based upon where the user was in the sign in and game process.

There are no unsolved problems, as far as the specifications for the project.
I would like to continue working on the user interface to make it a bit more
streamlined as far as navigation and not have the game board be so low on the
page.  I would also like to fix the formatting of the X and O images so they are
centered in the game board.  Finally, I would like to allow the user to see how
many games were won, and to have an O player sign in (not just the X player)
and have that user data stored.
